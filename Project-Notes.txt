## React: GitHub Battle ##

This is a practice React application I coded, following along with an intense, 4-hour long video series by the talented TylerMcGinnis.

This project covered React fundamentals such as routing, passing data via props, propTypes, and coding reusable modules.

This project also taught me how to manage workflows using Webpack and how to call APIs using Axios. 

I took it upon myself to improve the syntax using ES6, using Babel to transpile it down to ES5 for backwards compatibility.
